# YelpCamp-Web
The YelpCamp project is the final project of the Web Dev Bootcamp I took, it serves as both the Website, and the API for the mobile app that I made alongside it. Currently you can only access it via (here)[https://paradox-yelp-camp.herokuapp.com], and although signups are closed for the public, you can contact me to get a signup key if you so wish.
