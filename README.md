# YelpCamp-Web
[![DeepScan grade](https://deepscan.io/api/teams/8658/projects/10871/branches/155934/badge/grade.svg)](https://deepscan.io/dashboard#view=project&tid=8658&pid=10871&bid=155934)

The YelpCamp project is the final project of the Web Dev Bootcamp I took, it serves as both the Website, and the API for the mobile app that I made alongside it. Currently you can only access it via [here](https://paradox-yelp-camp.herokuapp.com), and although signups are closed for the public, you can contact me to get a signup key if you so wish.
